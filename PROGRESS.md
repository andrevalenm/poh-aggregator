# Autonomous build log — ax41

Append one block per iteration. Newest at the bottom. Read this before doing anything;
future iterations start with a blank context and only know what is written here.

Format:

```
## Iteration N — <ISO date>
**Did:** …
**Verified:** (the command you ran and what it printed)
**Committed:** <sha> <subject>
**Next:** …
**Blocked:** … (or none)
```

## Iteration 0 — 2026-07-25, handover

**Did:** Set up this working copy on ax41 from Hugo's laptop at commit `fa6c924`. Nothing
else — the queue in `MISSION.md` is untouched and P0 items are both open.

**State of the world at handover:**

- 66 tests green as of `c743f82` (18 contract, 25 scoring, 5 input, 12 live, 6 E2E).
- Registry v2 live on Sepolia at `0x977b028b900cce8ee89c46877e814eff3060aa07`.
- Protocol subgraph on Studio, synced. Registry audit-trail subgraph self-hosted on `:8100`.
- Demo served by the `corroborate-demo` container on `:8788`.
- 15 adapters in the ontology across 10 trust roots; **only 4 have live probes**.
- `node_modules` was not copied — run `pnpm install` before building or testing.
- Foundry is not installed here; `scripts/compile.mjs` uses solc via npm instead.

**Next:** P0 subgraph-first inversion (fixes the torn-read scoring bug), then P0 landscape
aggregation. Both are described with acceptance criteria in `MISSION.md`.

**Blocked:** nothing.
