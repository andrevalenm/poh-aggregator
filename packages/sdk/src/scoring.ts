/**
 * Root-cost aggregation.
 *
 * The rule is one line: **saturate within a trust root, sum across trust roots.**
 *
 * Additive scoring over credentials is wrong, and wrong specifically in the adversary's
 * favour. A farm's credentials are maximally correlated — one passport presented to every
 * protocol that reads passports — while a real person's credentials are diverse. Summing
 * therefore rewards exactly the pattern it is supposed to catch. Concretely: from one
 * government document a subject can hold World's document tier, ZKPassport and Self, and a
 * naive scorer credits three independent proofs for one trip to a passport office.
 *
 * We cannot fix this by deduplicating credentials, because we usually cannot tell that two
 * came from one document: ZKPassport scopes its nullifier per service and never publishes
 * an unscoped value, while Self publishes a global one — four protocols, four incompatible
 * derivations over the same chip. Dedup would require linking a user's credentials to each
 * other, which is the correlation their nullifier designs exist to prevent.
 *
 * So we work at the level of the credential *class* instead. We never need to know that
 * *this* subject's two credentials share a root — only that those two *protocols* read the
 * same root, which is a public fact about the world. Within a root we take the strongest
 * credential and discard the rest; across roots we add. Saturation is also the right move
 * under uncertainty: when correlation is unobservable it bounds the honest user's loss at
 * one root's worth, while the adversary's gain from additive scoring would grow without
 * limit in the number of protocols reading the same root.
 *
 * Cost is denominated in what it costs an adversary, not in what it proves. A credential is
 * only as strong as the cheaper of forging one and renting one, because a holder willing to
 * rent defeats any amount of cryptography.

 * Age weight from the adapter's curve and half-life.
 *
 * Decay: weight falls with age — a stale selfie or KYC check means less than a fresh one.
 * Ramp: weight RISES with survival — right for vouching registries, where the suspect
 * cohort is by definition the fresh one. PoH took ~95% of its lifetime registrations in a
 * four-month reward window; under Ramp a week-old registration weighs ~0.01 while one that
 * has survived challenge windows for two years approaches full weight. Uniform decay would
 * have given the airdrop cohort full weight and discounted the organic one — exactly
 * backwards.
 *
 * Unknown age: Decay returns 1 (the credential's existence was verified live on-chain, and
 * absence of a date must not silently penalise) but Ramp returns 0.5 — Ramp exists to
 * discount fresh farms, and granting full weight on missing data would make the subgraph
 * being unreachable strictly profitable for an attacker. Both cases are flagged by the
 * issuance-date-unknown caveat.
 *
 * `issuedAfter` is a proven lower bound on issuance — the credential was absent from an index
 * with complete history at a block that index named, so it cannot be older than that block.
 * On a Ramp curve, where weight rises with age, the curve evaluated at that bound is the
 * highest weight the evidence can support, so we take it as a *cap*, never as a grant:
 * `min(unknown-age policy, curve(bound))`. Two consequences, both wanted. A synced index
 * prices a brand-new credential as brand new (~0) instead of at the 0.5 midpoint, which is
 * the bug this fixes. And an attacker who makes our index lag can at best recover the 0.5 it
 * would have had anyway — lag is never worth more than it costs. On a Decay curve the same
 * bound is a lower bound on weight rather than an upper one (a younger credential decays
 * less), so it cannot tighten the unknown-age answer and is ignored there.
