/**
 * AgentBook — World Chain's human↔agent registry, read as a *fleet* index.
 *
 * `lookupHuman(agent)` answers the per-request question and `world.ts` already uses it. This
 * file answers the question a fleet policy needs and the mapping cannot: **which other agents
 * did this human register?** There is no reverse index — a `PUSH4` scan of the deployed
 * bytecode finds seventeen selectors and the only reads are `lookupHuman(address)`,
 * `getNextNonce(address)`, `groupId()`, `worldIdRouter()` and the ownership pair. Same shape as
 * Verax on Linea: a mapping keyed the wrong way for the question being asked.
 *
 * Unlike Verax, the whole registry fits in one scan. AgentBook was deployed at World Chain block
 * 27,053,063 (2026-03-13) and has emitted **1,164** `AgentRegistered(address indexed agent,
 * uint256 indexed humanId)` events in its life, one per transaction. Six chunked `eth_getLogs`
 * calls read the entire history in about five seconds, so the index this module builds is the
 * complete registry rather than a sample — and `fleetOf()` returns *all* of a human's agents,
 * not the ones we happened to be shown.
 *
 * ## Why the log is the whole truth here
 *
 * `register(address account, uint256 root, uint256 nonce, uint256 nullifierHash, uint256[8]
 * proof)` is the only function that writes the mapping, and it emits. There is no admin write
 * path (contrast Proof of Humanity v1's `addSubmissionManually`, which moved the counter with no
 * event, or Farcaster's `SetIdCounter` import) and no deregistration selector at all, so the
 * registry is append-only and the event stream reconstructs it exactly. That is asserted rather
 * than assumed: the live suite re-reads `lookupHuman` from *state* for a sample of the agents
 * the log names and requires the two to agree, and re-scans at a second chunk size to catch a
 * silently truncating endpoint.
 *
 * ## What `humanId` is, and what it is not
 *
 * It is the Semaphore nullifier hash the registering World ID proof produced — confirmed from
 * the chain rather than from documentation: in a real `register` transaction the fourth argument
 * equals the value the event carries in its second topic. Because a nullifier hash is
 * deterministic in (identity, external nullifier), one World ID always yields the same `humanId`
 * here, which is what makes "at most N agents per human" enforceable at all.
 *
 * It is also **scoped to this contract, and cannot be joined to any other World registry**.
 * `AgentBookInitialized` records an `externalNullifierHash` of
 * `38265997849925878342838486616706141368121079204652799064895347807228265498`, while
 * `WorldIDAddressBookInitialized` records `3775935569878740431654007528834557228959016923326436\
 * 78318174569531027326541`. Same router, same group 1 (the Orb), different external nullifier —
 * so the same human is two unlinkable pseudonyms across the two contracts by construction.
 * Measured: of 150 AgentBook humanIds tested against `WorldIDAddressBook.nullifierHashes`, zero
 * resolve. This is why an agent's operator address set stays *asserted* and carries
 * `address-set-not-authenticated`: no amount of chain reading gets from an agent to the wallets
 * its operator holds credentials on. That is a property of World's privacy design working as
 * intended, not a gap in this implementation.

/**
 * When a registration happened, for one agent — the date `lookupHuman` cannot give.
 *
 * `AgentBook` stores `mapping(address => uint256)` and nothing else: no timestamp, no term, no
 * expiry. So a World credential held only through this contract arrived at scoring undated, and
 * an undated credential on a `Decay` curve scores at freshness 1 (`freshnessOf`, `scoring.ts`) —
 * full weight, forever, for a registration that may be a year old. The date is on chain, in the
 * `AgentRegistered` log, one block away from the mapping write that produced it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a filtered query and not the fleet scan
 *
 * `scanAgentBook` reads the registry's whole history in six 1M-block calls and is the right shape
 * for a policy question about siblings. It is the wrong shape for a probe: a scoring request would
 * pay a five-second full-history scan to learn one timestamp. Filtering on the agent topic makes
 * the *result* small enough that the endpoint serves the entire 5.8M-block range in one call, so
 * the cost is two calls rather than six — and only for the wallets AgentBook actually knows.
 *
 * ## The canary is wide here, for a different reason than in the scan
 *
 * `scanAgentBook`'s canary asks a single block, because its risk is an endpoint that answers `[]`
 * for everything. This path's risk is narrower and quieter: an endpoint that serves recent blocks
 * and silently drops the older end of a wide range would return no log for an agent registered in
 * March, and "no registration in the log" would become "no date" — back to freshness 1, the
 * permissive answer this function exists to remove. So the canary runs the *same wide filtered
 * query* for an agent whose registration has been at block 27,100,652 since March. An endpoint
 * that cannot find it does not get to say anything about the subject.
 *
 * Never throws, and never conflates its failure modes. `not-found` is a fact about the log;
 * `unavailable` is a fact about us. The caller must not date a credential from either.
