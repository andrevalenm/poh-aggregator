/**
 * Human Passport (ex-Gitcoin Passport), read from the on-chain Decoder.
 *
 * Why this one is worth reading at all: it is the largest score in the landscape and it is
 * the only aggregate in it that can be read **without the vendor's cooperation**. Users who
 * paid to mint have their score cached on chain, and `GitcoinResolver.getCachedScore` answers
 * for anyone. No API key, no rate limit, nothing Passport can revoke.
 *
 * ## Why we do not import the number
 *
 * Passport's scalar is an aggregate over its own stamps with its own weights, and those
 * weights are not ours to inherit. `ETHScore#50` — a pure wallet-history model — is weighted
 * the same as a government ID (`research/protocols/passport-civic-fractal-zkme-galxe.md`).
 * Worse, the stamp list contains credentials this ontology already prices under their own
 * roots: Coinbase (Persona), Holonym gov-id, Holonym biometrics, Civic, BrightID, Idena,
 * TrustaLabs. Adding Passport's number to a score that already counts those would double-count
 * the exact correlation the root model exists to collapse.
 *
 * So the passport is rooted at `behavioral:wallet-history` and priced at the farmed-wallet
 * market — a dollar, not KYC money — and the score value is reported as detail and never
 * multiplied into anything. What the probe *does* do with the stamps is disclose them: it maps
 * each one to the ontology adapter that owns it and reports which roots this passport is
 * restating, so a caller can see that a score of 28.8 was three stamps, two of which we
 * already counted somewhere else. That is the "1inch for personhood" claim made legible on
 * one address rather than asserted in a pitch.
 *
 * ## Mechanism, verified against the deployed contracts on 2026-07-25
 *
 * `GitcoinPassportDecoder.getScore(user)` is revert-driven: `AttestationNotFound()` when
 * `cachedScore.time == 0`, `AttestationExpired(uint64)` when the score has aged out. We read
 * the resolver directly instead, because `getCachedScore` returns the same struct the Decoder
 * consults — `{ uint32 score, uint64 time, uint64 expirationTime }` — and it carries the
 * issuance date the Decoder throws away. That date is what feeds our decay curve, so taking
 * the revert path would have cost us the age of the credential for no gain.
 *
 * Expiry is `expirationTime` when set, else `time + maxScoreAge()` — 7,776,000 seconds, 90
 * days, on all seven deployments. That derivation is not folklore: for
 * `0xb0812e00…90F2` on Optimism, `time` 1740958699 + 7776000 = 1748734699, and
 * `getScore` reverts `AttestationExpired(1748734699)`. Same arithmetic, same number, from two
 * independent paths. `human-passport.live.test.ts` re-derives it rather than asserting it.
 *
 * ## Seven chains, because one is wrong
 *
 * A passport is minted per chain and the mints disagree. `0xb0812e00…90F2` holds 50.015 on
 * Optimism and Linea and 25.099 on Scroll — a year older — and nothing on Base, Arbitrum,
 * Shape or zkSync. Reading one chain would have reported the wrong score for two of the three
 * chains it exists on, and no score at all for most addresses. We read all seven and take the
 * most recently issued unexpired one, which is both the freshest evidence and the one the
 * subject most recently paid for.
 *
 * Per the rule at the top of `adapters/index.ts`, a probe never turns a failure into a
 * negative. A chain that does not answer is dropped; only if *every* chain fails to answer do
 * we return an `error`, because "no passport" and "we could not look" are different claims.
 */

/**
 * Decoder deployments, from the "Smart contracts → Contract reference" page of
 * docs.passport.human.tech (fetched 2026-07-24, tabulated in
 * `research/protocols/passport-civic-fractal-zkme-galxe.md`). Every one of these was confirmed
 * to hold code and to answer `maxScoreAge()` on 2026-07-25.
 *
 * The resolver address is deliberately *not* listed here. We ask each Decoder which resolver
 * it trusts (`gitcoinResolver()`) rather than hard-coding a second address per chain: it is one
 * cached call, it cannot drift out of date, and it means an upgrade on their side cannot leave
 * us reading a resolver the Decoder has stopped believing.
