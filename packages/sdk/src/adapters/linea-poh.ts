/**
 * Linea Proof of Humanity V2, read from the Verax attestation registry on Linea.
 *
 * ## Why this one looked unreadable, and why it is not
 *
 * Verax stores an attestation's `subject` as `bytes`, and the registry keeps attestations in a
 * mapping keyed by a sequential id. There is no subject index unless the issuing portal
 * registers Verax's `IndexerModule`, and the Sumsub portal registers **no modules at all**
 * (`getModules()` returns an empty array — asserted live). So the obvious read does not exist,
 * which is why Linea ships a signature-based path instead: `PohVerifier.verify(signature,
 * address)` consumes a blob you fetch from `poh-signer-api.linea.build`. Our own research
 * concluded from this that "there is no efficient on-chain *does address X have a PoH
 * attestation* read".
 *
 * That conclusion assumed we have to search. We do not, because **the credential expires**.
 *
 * A PoH V2 attestation carries a term of exactly 90 days (measured across the whole schema; see
 * `LINEA_POH_MAX_TERM_SECONDS`). `attestedDate` is the block timestamp at write, and ids are
 * handed out in order, so `attestedDate` is monotone in id. Therefore every *unexpired*
 * attestation in the entire registry — not just this schema's — lies in the contiguous id range
 *
 *     [ first id with attestedDate >= now - 90 days , attestationIdCounter )
 *
 * and on this registry that range is **765 ids wide** against a counter of 6,366,748. Reading it
 * whole costs six `eth_call` round trips through Multicall3 and yields the complete live
 * population: 500 unexpired attestations over 499 distinct addresses, measured 2026-07-25.
 * A probe is then a map lookup.
 *
 * So this adapter does not answer "is this address verified" by asking anyone. It enumerates
 * every live credential the protocol has issued, from the chain, and checks whether the subject
 * is in it. No indexer, no vendor endpoint, no API key — and as a side effect it knows the size
 * of the population it is answering about, which the vendor's boolean cannot tell you.
 *
 * ## The range is found by galloping, not bisecting, because we are going to read it anyway
 *
 * The classic move is to bisect for the boundary id and then scan forward from it. Here the
 * bisection is wasted work: a doubling ladder (`counter-1, counter-2, counter-4, …`) finds a
 * bracket at most twice the true window in **one** batched round trip, and scanning a bracket
 * twice as wide as necessary is cheaper than twenty sequential round trips to make it exact.
 * The scan *is* the boundary search. `LINEA_POH_LADDER_STEPS` bounds the ladder.
 *
 * Everything is read at one pinned block, so the counter cannot advance underneath the scan and
 * produce a view that is half of one moment and half of another — the torn read `reconcile.ts`
 * exists to prevent, in miniature.
 *
 * ## Who is allowed to say you are human
 *
 * Presence of an attestation under the right schema is *not* evidence, and this is the same
 * lesson the Holonym adapter learned from the Hub's own source comments. Verax's
 * `AttestationRegistry` checks one thing: that the caller is a portal registered in
 * `PortalRegistry`. Nothing stops a *different* portal writing under the Sumsub Proof of
 * Personhood schema — schema ownership does not restrict portals.
 *
 * So the probe pins the portal's registered **owner address**, and three facts we measured on
 * 2026-07-25 explain why it is that and not any of the other candidates:
 *
 * - **Not the portal address.** Sumsub has *three* registered portals under this owner. Our own
 *   research file named `0xe8a3a57e…b73922` as "the" PoH portal; that one has issued **four**
 *   attestations, all on 2025-07-02/03, all long expired. The 50,471 real ones came from
 *   `0x501e742C…7D5B46`. An adapter pinned to the researched address would have returned
 *   `held: false` for the entire population while looking like it worked.
 * - **Not `ownerName`.** It is a string the portal's creator supplies at registration. It says
 *   "Sumsub" on all three portals and it would say "Sumsub" on anyone else's too.
 * - **Not the `attester` field.** That is `msg.sender` on the portal's `attest` call. The portal
 *   gates on an ECDSA signature instead, which we established by simulating `attest` from a
 *   stranger *and* from Sumsub's own attester key and getting the identical revert
 *   (`ECDSAInvalidSignature`, `0xf645eedf`) — the gate is on the signature, not the caller.
 *
 * The owner address is the anchor Verax itself enforces: `PortalRegistry.isIssuer(owner)` is an
 * allowlist Consensys controls, `deployDefaultPortal` from a non-issuer reverts, and only a
 * registered portal can write to the registry at all. Both are re-read at runtime rather than
 * assumed, so a de-listing is visible immediately.
 *
 * The portal's authorised signer is then read *from the portal* (`signerAddress()`, which
 * returns Sumsub's attester key) rather than hard-coded, for the same reason the Human Passport
 * adapter asks each Decoder which resolver it trusts. It is reported as corroboration and not
 * used as a filter: it is a key Sumsub may rotate, and a rotation must not retroactively
 * un-verify people.
 *
 * ## What the ontology did not record
 *
 * The 90-day term means the `decayHalfLifeDays: 90` on this entry only ever applies over the
 * credential's single 90-day life — weight can never fall below one half — which is the third
 * instance of the same shape in this codebase (Human Passport hard-expires at 90 days against a
 * 180-day half-life; a Holonym credential expires within a year against 730). And the gap
 * between cumulative and live is enormous here: 50,475 attestations ever issued, 500 alive. A
 * scorer reading the cumulative count would price a population 100× larger than the one that
 * exists.
