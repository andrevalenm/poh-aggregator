/**
 * BrightID, read from the one on-chain registry that maps addresses to verifications: the
 * `BrightIDSnapshot` contract on IDChain.
 *
 * ## Why this registry, out of BrightID's many surfaces
 *
 * BrightID verifications are app-scoped: the graph labels *contextIds* (per-app UUIDs), not
 * addresses, and the node API answers only for apps that registered a context — which is why
 * the earlier sweep (`research/protocols/poh-kleros-brightid-idena.md`) called BrightID
 * readable-but-not-obtainable. The exception is the app whose contextIds *are* Ethereum
 * addresses: **`snapshot`**. For it, BrightID deployed a public registry on IDChain (their
 * own POA sidechain, chain id 74) at `0x81591DC4997A76A870c13D383F8491B288E09344` — the
 * contract Snapshot's official `brightid` voting strategy reads. `verify()` is a
 * permissionless relay: anyone may submit, validity comes from an ecrecover against a signer
 * holding the verifier token, and the state is a plain
 * `mapping(address => { uint256 time; bool isVerified })` plus an address-history chain.
 * That is exactly an address → verified map, readable by `eth_call` with no key and no
 * vendor. Verified source from the IDChain Blockscout, semantics confirmed live 2026-07-25.
 *
 * ## What held means, and what it is evidence of
 *
 * `held: true` means: a BrightID node holding the verifier token signed, at `issuedAt`, that
 * the human behind this address met the `snapshot` app's verification expression (the
 * social-graph "meets" criterion), and someone relayed that signature on chain. It is
 * social-graph vouching, not uniqueness and not liveness. The binding is consented — the
 * verification names the address, and only the address holder could obtain it — and it
 * cannot be planted: registering an address requires a node-signed message naming it.
 *
 * `isVerifiedUser` never expires on read. What unmakes it is the history mechanism: when a
 * user re-links to a new address, the old addresses are written `isVerified: false` with
 * their `time` kept — reported here as `detail.superseded`, distinct from never-registered.
 *
 * ## The honest catch: the registry is small and the write path is dead
 *
 * Measured 2026-07-25 over the chain's full history (IDChain's public RPC serves unbounded
 * `eth_getLogs`; 237 logs in ~9 s): **237 `Verified` events, 233 unique addresses**, first
 * 2022-01-22, last **2024-06-09** — no writes in over two years. And the write path needs a
 * BrightID node signature, but every BrightID node API endpoint checked returned 502 (dated
 * probes in `research/protocols/brightid-onchain-read.md`). So this is a frozen registry of
 * a few hundred addresses: the read is permissionless and the evidence is real for those who
 * hold it, but nobody new can obtain the credential today, which is why the ontology entry
 * must stay `live: false` and the forge cost is academic. IDChain itself is
 * protocol-operated (permissionless read, not infrastructure-independent — the Lens Chain
 * position), with `https://idchain.one/rpc` its only public endpoint.
