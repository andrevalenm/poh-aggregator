/**
 * Idena — a validated identity on the proof-of-person chain, read from its node RPC.
 *
 * ## Why this is readable for an Ethereum-address subject at all
 *
 * Idena addresses are secp256k1, derived exactly like Ethereum's: last 20 bytes of
 * keccak256(uncompressed pubkey). An Idena identity at address X is therefore a claim about
 * the *same keypair* our subject controls — no cross-chain account mapping is needed, which
 * is what separates this adapter from the Encointer refusal
 * (`research/protocols/encointer-onchain-read.md`).
 *
 * ## What the credential attests
 *
 * A validated state (`Newbie`, `Verified` or `Human`) means this key's holder solved a set of
 * AI-hard "flip" puzzles at the last synchronous validation ceremony — every participant
 * worldwide solves at the same announced instant, so one human cannot validate two identities.
 * The state is *not* durable: miss one ceremony and a Verified/Human identity drops to
 * Suspended, a Newbie is killed. **Recency is the signal** — a validated state is at most one
 * epoch old by construction, which is why `issuedAt` here is the *last* ceremony, not the
 * identity's first validation (its total tenure is reported as `detail.ageEpochs` instead).
 *
 * The honest caveat this file must carry: the network is ~124 validated identities worldwide
 * (epoch 214, 2026-07), down 99.2% from its 2022 peak, and the protocol's own founder
 * co-authored the paper showing that at 20x this size the network had collapsed into
 * puppeteered pools. The ontology prices that; the probe just reports the state faithfully —
 * including `delegatee`, because a pooled identity is exactly the puppeteering shape the
 * paper documented.
 *
 * ## The read, and its honest infrastructure position
 *
 * Idena is its own chain with its own JSON-RPC dialect (`dna_identity`, `dna_epoch`,
 * `bcn_blockAt`). There is no fully keyless public node: every Idena node gates RPC behind an
 * `api-key`. What exists is the **protocol's shared node** at `restricted.idena.io`, whose key
 * (`idena-restricted-node-key`) is a *public constant* baked into the deployed app.idena.io
 * web-client bundle (verified in `_app-fb1caf55….js`, 2026-07-25) — every keyless user of the
 * official web app authenticates with it. So the read is permissionless in every sense that
 * matters (nothing to register, nothing revocable per-caller) but, like the Lens Chain read,
 * it is protocol-operated and not infrastructure-independent: the operator could rotate the
 * key or the node globally, and `rpc.idena.io` / `node.idena.io` were both dead when checked
 * (2026-07-25). The restricted node also allowlists methods — `dna_identities` (list all) is
 * refused with a plain-text 403 — but the three methods this probe needs all answer.
 *
 * `api.idena.io` (the protocol's indexer) is deliberately **not** on any `held` path; the
 * live test suite uses it for candidate discovery only.
 *
 * ## Dating
 *
 * A validated state was necessarily earned at the most recent ceremony, and the current
 * epoch's `startBlock` is the first block after that ceremony, so its own timestamp — read
 * with `bcn_blockAt` — is a proven chain-state date for the validation, minutes-accurate.
 * Verified against epoch 215: startBlock 11,066,316, timestamp 1,784,648,021 =
 * 2026-07-21T~15:33Z, the epoch-214 ceremony afternoon. If the two dating calls fail after a
 * successful identity read, the probe degrades loudly: `held: true` stands (it was proven),
 * the date is dropped, and `detail.undated` says why.
