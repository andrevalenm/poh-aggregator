/**
 * EAS-based adapters, read **entirely from the chain**.
 *
 * The Coinbase probe in `index.ts` reads `base.easscan.org/graphql` — the hosted EASSCAN
 * indexer, a single-org, un-SLA'd service that returned a maintenance page mid-query during
 * our own research (`research/protocols/eas-and-disco.md`). That is precisely the vendor
 * dependency the rule at the top of `adapters/index.ts` forbids on the critical path. Both
 * adapters here answer from raw RPC against the EAS contracts themselves: `eth_call` for
 * state, `eth_getLogs` for discovery, nothing that can rate-limit or revoke us.
 *
 * The event every EAS deployment emits on attest is
 *
 *     event Attested(address indexed recipient, address indexed attester,
 *                    bytes32 uid, bytes32 indexed schemaUID)
 *
 * so `topics[1]` is the recipient, `topics[2]` the attester, `topics[3]` the schema and the
 * un-indexed `uid` is the 32-byte `data` payload. That layout is not assumed from the ABI —
 * this codebase has been burned by assumed topic layouts before — it was confirmed against a
 * live log on Base (block 49,105,239, uid `0x88a10ab4…c8a8b9`, recipient in `topics[1]`,
 * the Coinbase attester `0x3574…D7EE` in `topics[2]`, 2026-07-25), and the live suite
 * re-confirms it every run.

/**
 * Coinbase Verified Account, read from Base with no indexer service anywhere.

 * Same credential and semantics as `coinbaseVerificationAdapter` in `index.ts` — Persona-
 * rooted KYC-account linkage, revocation-checked — but the answer comes from the chain:
 *
 * 1. **Primary: two `eth_call`s.** Coinbase's on-chain `AttestationIndexer` maps
 *    `(recipient, schemaUID) -> latest uid`; `EAS.getAttestation(uid)` then carries issuance,
 *    revocation and expiry. Complete history, no log scan, ~2 RPC round-trips per probe.
 * 2. **Cross-check on absence.** A zero uid from the indexer is confirmed against recent
 *    `Attested` logs (recipient, attester and schema all pinned in the topics) before being
 *    believed, so a re-pointed or abandoned indexer contract fails loudly instead of quietly
 *    reporting everyone unverified.
 * 3. **Fallback: chunked `eth_getLogs`.** If the indexer read fails entirely, the probe scans
 *    backward from head in windows sized to what each endpoint actually serves (measured, see
 *    `BASE_EAS_ENDPOINTS`) within a call budget. A full-history scan through 10k-block
 *    windows would be ~4,400 calls — not a sane per-probe cost — so the scan is bounded, and
 *    when it finds nothing the result says exactly which blocks were searched
 *    (`detail.scannedFromBlock`/`scannedToBlock`, `scanComplete: false`) rather than
 *    asserting an absence over history it never read.

 * `_gitcoinAttester()`, so a resolver bug or migration cannot smuggle in someone else's
 * numbers), the **revocation state** as EAS records it, and — on score-v2 — the **stamps
 * inline**, so the disclosure of which trust roots the score restates no longer depends on
 * the separate `getPassport` call that reverts for community-scoped scores.
 *
 * Discovery needs no logs at all: the resolver's public `userAttestations` mapping
 * (`getUserAttestation(subject, schemaUID)`) is the address→uid index, on chain, populated
 * atomically by the same hook that validates every attest. Schema UIDs are *derived* — see
 * `deriveSchemaUID` — from the schema string and the resolver address the Decoder names, so
 * nothing here goes stale when Passport re-deploys a resolver.
 *
 * Everything the sibling adapter says about **meaning** stands unchanged: the scalar is
 * Passport's weighting, not ours; it is rooted at `behavioral:wallet-history` and the
 * high-weight stamps are priced under their own roots. This adapter restates the stamp list
 * from the attestation payload for exactly that decomposition.
 *
 * Per-probe cost, measured shape: 3 cached config `eth_call`s per chain per process
 * lifetime, then 2–3 `eth_call`s per chain per probe (uid lookup, optional legacy retry,
 * `getAttestation`). No `eth_getLogs` on any path.
