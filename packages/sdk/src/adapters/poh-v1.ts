/**
 * Proof of Humanity **v1**, read from the original registry on Ethereum mainnet.
 *
 * Same trust root as v2 (`social-vouching:poh`) and deliberately so: a subject registered in
 * both holds one vouched identity, not two, and saturation is the thing that says so. This
 * adapter exists to make that collapse observable on real data rather than asserted.
 *
 * ## `isRegistered` is a comparison, not a presence check
 *
 * The registry's own getter is the whole mechanism, and the verified source says it plainly:
 *
 *     function isRegistered(address _submissionID) external view returns (bool) {
 *         Submission storage submission = submissions[_submissionID];
 *         return submission.registered && now - submission.submissionTime <= submissionDuration;
 *     }
 *
 * `submission.registered` is **never cleared on expiry** — only a governor removal or a lost
 * revocation request clears it — so the struct's boolean stays true forever while the credential
 * dies of arithmetic. Of 215 addresses sampled from the registry's recent request history,
 * **33 have `registered == true` and `isRegistered() == false`**. Reading the struct field, which
 * is the obvious thing to do given `getSubmissionInfo` returns it, would count every one of them
 * as a verified human.
 *
 * The comparison is exact and was checked against history rather than trusted: for submission
 * `0xfc3e23d4…3563` (`submissionTime` 1,642,619,590, term 63,115,200) `isRegistered` is **true**
 * at block 19,046,504 — timestamp 1,705,734,779, eleven seconds before expiry — and **false** at
 * block 19,046,505, one second after. Nothing was written to the contract in between.
 *
 * `submissionDuration()` is governance-settable and *has* moved: it was 31,557,600 s (365.25 days)
 * at the registry's first submission in 2021-03 and is 63,115,200 s (730.5 days) today. So the
 * probe reads it rather than pinning it, and reports the expiry it implies.
 *
 * ## The ForkModule decides whether the credential is still the subject's to spend
 *
 * PoH v2 cannot write to the frozen v1 contract, so it keeps its own overlay: `ForkModule`
 * (`0x068a27Db…9cCB`, initialised 2024-09-05) with `mapping(address => bool) removed`. v2 sets it
 * through `tryRemove` when a v1 submission is claimed or transferred into v2, and through
 * `remove` when a humanity is revoked, loses a revocation request, or is punished for bad
 * vouching. In every one of those cases the PoH ecosystem has stopped honouring the v1
 * registration while the v1 contract itself goes on answering `true` until the term runs out.
 *
 * So `held` is `v1.isRegistered(subject) && !forkModule.removed(subject)`. Both directions of
 * getting this wrong are real: without the flag a human revoked by v2's arbitration keeps
 * scoring here for up to two years, and a migrated registration is counted a second time beside
 * the v2 humanity it became. Saturation would absorb the second case — same root — but not the
 * first, and reporting a revoked credential as held is a false statement about a person whether
 * or not it moves the number.
 *
 * We do **not** use `ForkModule.isRegistered`, which is the same two conditions plus
 * `submissionTime < forkTime`. That last one is v2's migration policy — "this registration is old
 * enough to be brought across" — and not a statement about whether a v1 credential exists. It
 * matters here rather than being a hypothetical: both of the registrations alive today were made
 * *after* the fork, so `ForkModule.isRegistered` is false for the entire live population.
 *
 * ## What is actually left of v1
 *
 * Enumerated from the chain at block 25,610,404 (2026-07-25): **20,740 submissions in the
 * registry's lifetime, 2 of them currently registered.** The enumeration is every address that
 * ever emitted `AddSubmission` or `ReapplySubmission` (20,682 distinct, full history from the
 * deployment block), which is complete for anything that can be alive today because
 * `submissionTime` is only ever written by a path one of those two events precedes — with one
 * exception that is provably harmless: `addSubmissionManually` emits no `AddSubmission` at all,
 * and the governor used it for 63 submissions on 2021-03-12 (visible as a permanent gap between
 * `submissionCounter` and the distinct event count, opened between blocks 12,023,878 and
 * 12,023,879). Those 63 are dated 2021 and expired years ago under either term; had any of them
 * renewed, the renewal would have emitted `ReapplySubmission` and be in the set.
 *
 * Both survivors expire in 2026 — 2026-09-07 and 2026-11-16 — after which the registry holds
 * nobody unless somebody registers afresh. That is what `live: true` means for this adapter: the
 * contract works, the population is two people, and the ontology note says so. A protocol that
 * still answers is not the same as a protocol that still has users, and the honest way to
 * aggregate the difference is to read it rather than to describe it.
