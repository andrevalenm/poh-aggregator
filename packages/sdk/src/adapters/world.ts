/**
 * World ID (Orb tier), read from World Chain.
 *
 * ## What was wrong with reading only AgentBook
 *
 * The previous version of this adapter asked `AgentBook.lookupHuman(subject) != 0`. That read is
 * correct and permissionless, and it has two problems. It covers only the wallets that registered
 * an agent through AgentKit — **1,068 transactions in the contract's life**, measured 2026-07-25 —
 * and it carries **no date**. An undated credential on a `Decay` curve scores at freshness 1
 * (`freshnessOf`, `scoring.ts`), so every World credential we found was priced as if it had been
 * issued this morning. That is the direction that pays an adversary.
 *
 * The fix is a different contract on the same chain.
 *
 * ## WorldIDAddressBook: the registry World actually populates
 *
 * `WorldIDAddressBook` (`0x57b930D5…E0330D`, Blockscout tags it "World Chain: World ID Address
 * Book" from worldcoin.org, deployed 2024-08-27 at block 2,711,105) stores one mapping:
 *
 *     mapping(address => uint256) addressVerifiedUntil
 *
 * and `verify()` writes `addressVerifiedUntil[account] = block.timestamp + verificationLength`
 * after `worldIdRouter.verifyProof(...)` accepts a World ID group-1 proof. So a single `eth_call`
 * gives us both halves of the answer:
 *
 * - **held**: `addressVerifiedUntil[subject] > block.timestamp`. Not `!= 0` — the value is never
 *   cleared, so a lapsed verification is a nonzero number in the past, and treating presence as
 *   evidence would count people whose binding died months ago. Roughly half of a sampled 2025-04
 *   cohort is in exactly that state.
 * - **issuedAt**: `verifiedUntil - verificationLength()`, which is *exactly* the timestamp of the
 *   block the verification was mined in. Confirmed on 24 sampled verifications spanning
 *   2025-04-18 to 2026-07-25, every one to the second, and asserted every run by the live suite
 *   against a fresh sample. `verificationLength` is 14,515,200 s (168 days) and has been since the
 *   contract's `WorldIDAddressBookInitialized` event; it is read at runtime rather than pinned, so
 *   a governance change is visible instead of silently re-dating everybody.
 *
 * Coverage is not comparable to AgentBook's: sampled 100-block windows give ~28,000 verifications
 * a day at head and 60,000–80,000 a day through 2025, against a 168-day term.
 *
 * ## What the date means, and why it is honest to use it
 *
 * `verifiedUntil - verificationLength` is when this address last re-proved a World ID — not when
 * the human enrolled at an Orb. The enrolment date (`genesis_issued_at`) lives inside the v4
 * credential and is never published on chain. So this adapter dates the *binding*, which is the
 * thing the contract actually attests, and says so through the `date-from-latest-reattestation`
 * note. On a decay curve that is the conservative reading of what the chain knows: the human's
 * iris capture is older than the date we use, and the binding it proves is exactly this fresh.
 *
 * ## The AgentBook half, dated from its own log
 *
 * `AgentBook.lookupHuman` is the other way this credential is held, and until now it was the last
 * undated credential in the roster — the same defect in the other registry. It stores a mapping
 * and nothing else: no term, no expiry, no timestamp. But the write emits `AgentRegistered`, and
 * that log has a block, so the date exists on chain and was simply not being read. It is fetched
 * (`registrationOf`, `agentbook.ts`) only for wallets the mapping says are registered — a filtered
 * query costing two calls, not the six-call fleet scan — and it is refused unless the log's
 * `humanId` is the one state just returned, so a truncated or stale log cannot date a binding it
 * has not actually seen.
 *
 * What that date means is narrower than an enrolment and wider than nothing: at that block the
 * operator proved a live group-1 Orb credential to this contract, because `register` verifies the
 * proof before it writes. Registration never expires and cannot be undone, so it is the only
 * freshness signal the contract has, and the note `date-from-agent-registration` says exactly that.
 *
 * When both registries answer, the date used is **the later of the two** — each is a moment the
 * chain accepted an Orb proof for this address, and the most recent one is the freshest thing
 * known. Neither can be manufactured without a real proof, so there is no cheap way to move it.
 * Both dates are reported in `detail` so a consumer can check the choice rather than trust it.
 *
 * ## One live verification per human, enforced on chain
 *
 * `verify()` reverts `VerificationAlreadyActive()` when the proof's nullifier is already mapped to
 * a *different* address whose verification has not expired. So at any moment a World human has at
 * most one live AddressBook entry — a per-human uniqueness property that survives the address
 * being changed, and one that our fleet policy can rely on rather than infer.
 *
 * ## Why an entry means a real Orb proof, and not a signature from World
 *
 * Simulating `AddressBook.verify(...)` with a junk proof reverts identically from a stranger, from
 * the relayer that submits real verifications, and from the contract's own owner — so the gate is
 * the proof, not the caller. Which check fails is itself informative: with a made-up merkle root
 * the revert is `NonExistentRoot()` (`0xddae3b71`, the root-history check), and with the group's
 * current root it advances to `ProofInvalid()` (`0x7fcdd1f4`, the Groth16 pairing check). Both are
 * asserted live, from three senders, every run.
 *
 * The router the AddressBook trusts was changed once, on 2026-01-08, from the canonical
 * `WorldIDRouter` to an unverified shim (`0xB012Bc9D…65Caa`) that reads the AddressBook and then
 * calls that same canonical router — the call chain AddressBook → shim → WorldIDRouter →
 * WorldIDRouterImplV1 → group-1 identity manager → Groth16 verifier → bn256 pairing precompiles is
 * visible in the trace of any real verification. `groupId` is 1 and has never changed, and group 1
 * is Orb-only: World ID's device tier was never verifiable on chain.
 *
 * ## The document and Selfie tiers are not readable here, on purpose
 *
 * World ID 4.0's NFC-document (schema 9303) and Selfie Check (schema 11) credentials leave no
 * per-holder trace on any chain: `WorldIDVerifier` is a `view` function taking a proof (its proxy
 * has received **2 transactions in its life**), and `CredentialSchemaIssuerRegistry` is keyed by
 * issuer schema id and stores issuer pubkeys, not holders. Both address-keyed registries on World
 * Chain — this one and AgentBook — consume v3 group-1 proofs, which is the Orb. Reading the other
 * two tiers requires World's Developer Portal with a registered `rp_id`, which is the vendor
 * dependency this package exists without. They stay in the ontology, unimplemented and documented,
 * rather than being scored from a source that can revoke us. See
 * `research/protocols/world-id-onchain-read.md`.
