/**
 * Lens account, read from Lens Chain — with the Polygon v2 registry as an honest fallback.
 *
 * ## Which Lens, in 2026
 *
 * Lens left Polygon. Lens Chain (a ZKsync-stack L2, chain id 232, GHO gas) produced its first
 * block on 2025-02-21 and launched publicly on 2025-04-04, migrating ~650k v2 profiles; on
 * 2026-01-20 stewardship passed from Avara to Mask Network. The v2 `LensHub` on Polygon was
 * *not* frozen — it still answers, still holds every profile NFT (migration copied, it did not
 * burn), and still trickles new mints (+647 profiles in the 15 months after sunset, measured
 * 2026-07-25) — but the canonical registry is now the Lens Chain one, so that is what this
 * probe reads first.
 *
 * ## What this is evidence of, and what it is not
 *
 * **Account ownership, never personhood** — and cheaper than a Farcaster id. Account creation
 * on Lens Chain is gas-sponsored: a fresh account plus an auto-generated `lens/` username cost
 * the user nothing and the sponsor 0.0012 GHO (~0.12 cents, measured from a live creation tx on
 * 2026-07-25, gasUsed 440,888 at 2.77 gwei). There is no storage rent and no recurring price of
 * any kind. The ontology must price this at effectively zero and lean entirely on the `Ramp`:
 * an account that has survived since the v2 era is worth a few cents of aged-account-market
 * value; one minted this week is worth nothing.
 *
 * ## The read: every account leaves an ownership-transfer log
 *
 * Lens v3 has no owner-keyed registry. A user's "profile" is an `Account` *contract* deployed
 * by the `AccountFactory`, owned by their EOA, and nothing on chain maps owner → account as
 * state. Worse, `Lens_Account_Created.owner` is useless for a reverse lookup: **every** account
 * — migrated and brand-new alike — is created with `owner = LensFactory` and only then
 * transferred to the user (verified on migrated and current signups, 2026-07-25).
 *
 * What does work: the `Account` contract emits
 * `Lens_Account_OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)`
 * on construction and on every ownership change, and Lens Chain's own public RPC serves
 * `eth_getLogs` over the chain's *entire* history (6.1M blocks at measurement) filtered by the
 * indexed `newOwner` — sub-second warm, tens of seconds cold. So the probe is: one full-history
 * log query for transfers to the subject, then for each candidate account an `owner()` call to
 * confirm the subject still holds it, and a factory-scoped creation-log lookup to confirm the
 * account really was deployed by the canonical `AccountFactory` — without that last check,
 * anyone could emit the transfer event from a contract of their own and mint themselves a
 * credential.
 *
 * Because every ownership change emits the event, the last transfer-to-subject block *is* the
 * acquisition — no bisection, no continuity doubt, unlike Farcaster's `custodyOf` search. Note
 * the symmetric weakness: ownership transfer needs no consent from the recipient, so a Lens
 * account can be *planted* on any address. That direction pays no adversary (it gives weight
 * away), but it means `held: true` here must never be read as an act of the subject.
 *
 * ## Dating, and the migration
 *
 * `issuedAt` is the acquisition, not the account's creation — same custody principle as the
 * Farcaster adapter, because accounts are a traded asset. Three cases, told apart on chain:
 *
 * - **Fresh signup**: acquired in the account's creation block. Clean date.
 * - **Migration claim**: bulk-migrated accounts sat with Lens's migration custodian EOA
 *   (`0x6e32…dFEc`) until the v2 owner claimed them; `previousOwner` names it. The claim date
 *   understates the credential's true age — the v2 profile may date to 2022 — so the result
 *   carries `date-from-registry-import`, which on a Ramp makes the weight a floor.
 * - **Anything else changed hands**: flagged `credential-transferred-since-issuance` and dated
 *   from the sale, so a bought 2022-era account is priced at its purchase date, not its age. A
 *   migration claim routed through an address other than the known custodian lands here too —
 *   mislabeled in the conservative direction.
 *
 * ## The legacy fallback, bounded rather than guessed
 *
 * A v2 holder who never claimed on Lens Chain would read `held: false` above, yet their profile
 * NFT is real and sits in a registry that still answers. So when Lens Chain shows nothing, the
 * probe reads `LensHub.balanceOf` on Polygon. A bare boolean would hand the unknown-age ramp
 * midpoint to anyone who buys a dead v2 profile for dust, so the date is bounded with one
 * archive read at block 70,000,000 (2025-04-07, the sunset): held there → `issuedAt` = the
 * sunset timestamp, a floor that understates true age; not held there → acquired after sunset,
 * `issuedAfter` caps the ramp instead. Archive unreachable → no date at all, and the detail
 * says so. The fallback never fires for migrated-and-claimed users — their Polygon NFT still
 * exists, but the Lens Chain read already answered, which is also why this adapter is one
 * credential and not two: both registries describe the same account.
