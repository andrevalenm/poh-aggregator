 * Subgraph client — the SDK's source for what a boolean contract read cannot see.

 * `isHuman(addr)` answers "does this credential exist"; it cannot answer "was it revoked", or
 * "what is this avatar's position in the trust graph". Those live in indexed history, and the
 * subgraph is where we read them.
 *
 * Every read here returns the **block the index had reached**, in the same request as the
 * entity, so the answer is a statement about a named block rather than about "now". That is
 * what lets `reconcile.ts` tell three different things apart that the old code collapsed into
 * one `undefined`: the index does not have this credential *at a block it names*, the index
 * cannot see this credential's history at all, and the index did not answer. The first is
 * evidence; the last two are not.
